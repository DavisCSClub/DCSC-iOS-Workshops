Collection Views
===

In this session, we learned how to use UI Collection Views (and to an extent UI Table Views). These views are essential in making more complicated and unique layouts for our applications, and are seen in pretty much every application in the app store! Very good to know, as you might imagine.

Taught on November 3rd, 2015, by Christy Franks. Primary audience : Programmers with Swift experience, and basic iOS development experience. Those who understand the materials from weeks one and two should be able to understand it.
